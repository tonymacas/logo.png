      <h1>Sustaining Forests</h1>
      <p>Our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests. We will continue to lead the world in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come. International Paper is committed to
        making quality products and ensuring responsible stewardship of the forests that supply our wood. We have a Global Responsible Fiber Procurement Policy that states we will not knowingly accept fiber from illegally logged forests or from forests
        where high conservation values are threatened by management activities.</p>
      <p>Our global demand for fiber is an important economic driver for the existence of tens of millions of acres of forested land. When consumers use wood-based products, they provide a direct financial incentive for landowners to keep working forests
        working. International Paper is a strong proponent of efforts to combat illegal logging and trade. As the largest procurer of fiber in the world, we are focused on preventing illegally harvested wood products from entering U.S. and global marketplaces.
        We support the U.S. Lacey Act, and the EU Timber Regulation, which are important laws that help combat illegal logging and prohibit trafficking of illegally harvested products while protecting the competitiveness of legally harvested trees. International
        Paper has worked to oppose changes that would weaken the U.S. law.</p>
